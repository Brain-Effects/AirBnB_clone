# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This is the first step towards building your first full web application.

## Description of the Project

This project is an attempt to clone the AirBnB application. The first step is to write a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. Thi will use what I build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

## Description of the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is similar to a Shell but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc.
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
